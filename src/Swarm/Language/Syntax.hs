  | -- | An integer literal.

  | -- | An antiquoted Haskell variable name of type Text.

  | -- | A Boolean literal.

  | -- | A variable.
    TVar Var
  | -- | A pair.
    TPair Term Term
  | -- | A lambda expression, with or without a type annotation on the
    --   binder.
    TLam Var (Maybe Type) Term
  | -- | Function application.
    TApp Term Term
  | -- | A (recursive) let expression, with or without a type
    --   annotation on the variable.
    TLet Var (Maybe Polytype) Term Term
  | -- | A (recursive) definition command, which binds a variable to a
    --   value in subsequent commands.

  | -- | A monadic bind for commands, of the form @c1 ; c2@ or @x <- c1; c2@.
